def toeplitz(c: Polynomial, k: int):

    Note:
        Assuming that c is supported on :math:`(-\infty, n]`, this matrix will act as the linear operator :math:`f \mapsto z^k P (c z^{-k} f)`, where :math:`P` is the Cauchy projection annihilating any negative-degree term.

    Toeplitz matrix of `c` and and `I` is the identity matrix. Solving the associated
    linear system yields the Riemann-Hilbert factorization of `(a, b)`, whose ratio is
    approximated by `c`. The Toeplitz matrix will be computed using `toeplitz(c, k)`,
    see the documentation for `toeplitz` for more information.

    Args:
        c (Polynomial): The Laurent polynomial `c` that approximates `b/a`. It should have support in :math:`(-\infty, d]`.
        k (int): Parameter passed to the `toeplitz` function. The function will compute the Riemann-Hilbert factorization from the k-th element of the NLFT. This parameter should not go over the end of the support of `c`.
